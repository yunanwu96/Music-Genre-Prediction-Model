# Music-Genre-Prediction-Model
Machine learning models used to predict the genre of music based on music characteristics
1. Introduction
The "Music Genre" dataset is sourced from Kaggle and serves as the foundation for training a machine learning model. The objective of this project is to predict the genre of a given music track based on various attributes such as popularity, key, energy, tempo, liveness, etc. The dataset includes detailed information, both numerical and categorical, about each music track along with its corresponding genre. The choice of this dataset is driven by the availability of numerous numerical attributes extracted using the Spotify algorithm, facilitating regression model construction and further analysis.
The project aims to apply the knowledge and methods learned throughout the course to answer two research questions. The research questions and the proposed solution methods are as follows:
Does the popularity of music vary significantly based on the genre?
To address this question, a One-Way ANOVA test will be performed to determine if there are significant differences in the popularity means among different music genres.
Can we predict certain music features based on the characteristic values of the music?
This question involves building a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to predict the acousticness of music based on other numerical music features, while also considering the music genre through the use of dummy variables.

2. Methods
To tackle the first research question, a One-Way ANOVA test is employed. ANOVA allows for testing the equality of means across three or more populations by analyzing sample variances. In this case, the independent variable is the music genre, making One-Way ANOVA the appropriate choice. The assumptions for ANOVA are satisfied based on the normal distribution of popularity for each genre, independence of popularity across genres, and equal variances among genres.
For the second research question, a GLM is constructed to predict music acousticness. The model includes relevant numerical music features as predictors and incorporates dummy variables representing the music genre. The backward selection method is utilized to identify the most impactful predictors, with the Akaike information criterion (AIC) serving as a measure of model validity.

3. Analysis
After the data cleaning process, the dataset consists of 50,000 observations and 28 variables. The summary statistics and structure of the cleaned dataset are provided in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. The distributions of the independent variables are visualized in Figures 10 to 19, revealing the characteristics of each attribute.
To address the first research question, an analysis of the relationship between music genre and popularity is conducted. A music genre and popularity table (Table 4) is created, and bar plots (Figure 4) and box plots (Figure 5 & Figure 6) are generated to visualize the popularity rankings and distribution of each music genre. The results indicate significant differences in the average popularity across genres, with jazz ranking the highest and anime being the least popular genre.
For the second research question, the dataset is further cleaned by selecting relevant numerical values and creating dummy variables to represent the music genre. A GLM is then fitted, yielding coefficients for each predictor. The model's effectiveness is assessed using the null deviance and residual deviance, and a Chi-Square statistic test is performed to evaluate the model fit.

4. Interpretation & Conclusions
Based on the analysis of the first research question, it is concluded that the popularity of music varies significantly among different genres. Jazz emerges as the most popular genre, while anime exhibits the lowest average popularity. The GLM constructed for the second research question indicates that certain predictors, such as danceability, energy, and valence, significantly impact music acousticness. The model demonstrates high effectiveness in predicting acousticness, as evidenced by the low AIC value.
Further research can explore the contribution of other music features to the overall prediction of acousticness. Additionally, the dataset can be expanded to include a larger and more diverse set of music genres, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of genre-related characteristics.
Moreover, it would be beneficial to explore the relationship between music genre and other music attributes, such as tempo, energy, and instrumentalness. This analysis could provide insights into genre-specific patterns and help in understanding the distinctive qualities of different music genres.
Furthermore, future research can consider employing more advanced machine learning techniques, such as ensemble methods or deep learning algorithms, to improve the accuracy of genre prediction or to explore additional research questions related to music analysis.
In conclusion, this project successfully addresses the research questions by conducting a One-Way ANOVA test to examine the relationship between music genre and popularity and by constructing a GLM to predict music acousticness. The findings highlight the significant variation in popularity across different genres and demonstrate the predictive power of music features in determining acousticness. This project provides a foundation for further exploration of music genre analysis and prediction, paving the way for future studies in this domain.
